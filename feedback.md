# Engineering-Empathy: Feedback

#### ASK - Actionable, Specific, Kind

#### Actionable
* Good
  * Identify things that are under their control
  * e.g. Their behavior, words, actions
* Bad
    * Identify things not in their control
    * e.g. "Your forehead is annoying"

#### Specific
  * Good
    * Comment about 1 thing in particular
  * Bad
    * Generic comment about many things simultaneously

** *The more specific your feedback, the more valuable it is **

#### Kind
  * Good
    * Be honest about the impact their actions have on you
    * Truth is Kind
    * e.g When you step on my toes, it hurts
  * Bad
    * Shit Sandwich
    * Projecting onto the other person
    * e.g. You're a terrible dancer

********************************************************************

** Don't Give Advice **

Giving advise robs the other person of the opportunity of receiving the feedback, deriving meaning from the feedback, and integrating the feedback.

** Don't Shit Sandwich **

Shit Sandwich is saying 2 nice things around every critical comment. This implies that you don't think the other person is mature enough to hear the critical feedback and it dilutes your positive feedback.

** Don't Compare **

Don't rank or compare. Give feedback in terms relative to an objective standard, not compared to another person.
